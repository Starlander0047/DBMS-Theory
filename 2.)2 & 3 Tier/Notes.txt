-->2-Tier architecture is also called as client server architecture(2 layers)
-->Its disadvantages are: i.)If number of clients increases it creates a problem(less scalability)
                         ii.)Clients are directly connecting to DB this creates a security issue
-->Advantages are: Easy to maintain
-->When we go to a bank or railway station to get the ticket availability checked by the authorized officers


-->In three tier architecture we have client layer, business layer, and DB layer. Whenever a client asks for
   data the respective query runs in the business layer and then after getting processed it goes to the
   DB. This reduces load on DB. After this the DB sends data to business layer which again shows the desired
   data to the client. But in case of two tier architecture the query is processed in the DB and this 
   increases risk
-->As a consequence Scalability and Security Increases
-->Generally 3-Tier is used for load balancing.
-->eg. All websites

--> In a two-tier architecture, the client is on the first tier. The database server and web application server reside on the same server machine, which is the second tier.

-->In both of the architectures client uses an interface to get the data and send request
