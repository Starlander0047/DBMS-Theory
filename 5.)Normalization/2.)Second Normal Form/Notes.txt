-->Table should be in First Normal Form|
-->There should be no partial dependency(or full functional dependent)|

-->To convert to 2NF see img2. With candidate key we inserted all fully dependent non prime attributes in a table. And made another table in which the partial dependent attributes are there with its own candidate key.


                                 _________________The problem with partial dependency_________________

Suppose AB is the candidate key and situation is like given in the img1.
Then B can alone decide C without A, this should not be the case. Both AB should deicide C. If AB is candidate key then either A or B can be null, but not both. So, in a situation like:         B will not be able to determine C.
