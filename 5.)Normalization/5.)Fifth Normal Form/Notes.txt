-->Decomposition is of two major types in DBMS:
            1.)Lossless
            2.)Lossy

-->Problems in decomposition maybe: 
            1.)It can be Lossy
            2.)It may not be able to preserve dependency

-->For normalization we need to decompose the table(into more than one)
-->It is necessary to keep at least one common attribute in two resultant tables
-->On doing union of the attributes in the tables after decomposition the resultant attributes should
   be same as in original table

-->To have a Lossless decomposition we should always take the common attribute in the table as the CK or SK
   of either T1 or T2 or both

-->A relation R satisfies join dependency if R is equal to the join of R1,R2,.....Rn where Ri is a 
   subset of the set of attributes of R.
