-->Minimal Cover or Irreducible set of FDs.
-->A minimal cover is a simplified and reduced version of the given set of functional dependencies. Since it is a reduced version, it is also called as Irreducible set.
-->Step   i.)Decompose right side of all FDs to a single attribute.

         ii.)Remove redundant FDs, choose one say A->B and see if leaving this FD, with the help of other
             FDs are we able to get A->B, if yes then remove A->B.

        iii.)Now, try to make the left side a single attribute. Say we have AC->B
             remove C if the closure of A has C. Remove A if closure of C has A(transitive property).
             Or, simply just find (AB)+ and after that find A+ and C+(without AC->B), if A+ and (AB)+ are same then Make it A->B. Or, make if C->B if C+ and
             (AB)+ are equal. If they are not same then let AC->B.


**-->canonical cover and minimal cover both are very close to each other basic difference is in canonical
     cover you can have more than one attribute at right hand side but in minimal cover you can have 
     only one, rest everything is same aim of both cover is to have remove redundant dependencies from
     our database.
