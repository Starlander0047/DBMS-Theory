-->In theoretical computer science, the CAP theorem, also named Brewer's theorem after computer scientist Eric Brewer, states that any distributed data store can provide only two of the following three guarantees.

-->The use of the word consistency in CAP and its use in ACID do not refer to the same identical concept. 
In CAP, the term consistency refers to the consistency of the values in different copies of the same data item in a replicated distributed system. In ACID, it refers to the fact that a transaction will not violate the integrity constraints specified on the database schema.
