Keys are of seven broad types in DBMS:

Candidate Key
Primary Key
Super Key
Alternate Key
Composite Key
Foreign Key
Unique Key

->Unique keys are columns in a relational database table that uniquely identify items in the rows. This sounds a lot like a primary key, but the main difference is that unique keys can have NULL values. Their purpose is to prevent duplicate items in rows, but the items in the row also don't need to have a value.
