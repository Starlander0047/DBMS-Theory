Irrecoverable Schedule:
-->If a transaction does a dirty read operation from an uncommitted transaction and commits before the
   transaction from where it has read the value, then such a schedule is called an irrecoverable schedule.

Lost Update:
-->A lost update problem occurs due to the update of the same record by two different transactions at the 
   same time. In simple words, when two transactions are updating the same record at the same time in a
   DBMS then a lost update problem occurs.

Unrepeatable Read:
-->The unrepeatable read problem occurs when two or more different values of the same data are read during
   the read operations in the same transaction.

Note: Dirty read occurs when a transaction reads data that has not yet been committed
