-->It is Logical Representaion of data(in RDBMS it can be a single table or multiple tables)
-->The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed

-->The relation between different tables is defined in conceptual schema it is mainly based on the ER model
   (size of tables, name of tables etc)

-->Where the data is actually stored, in which hard disk etc comes in physical schema

.If we make a simple php or other websites(it is at the external schema level)
.database designers work at conceptual level where they just design the conceptual model
.at the physical level it is the DB administrator who decides where the data is be to kept(it can be centralized
 or decentralized)

-->The data is stored in form of files in DB but it is shown to the user as its schema suggests
-->The DBA should be able to change the database storage structure without disturbing the userâ€™s views


-->Data independence is making the data independent of user or making data abstract(on diff levels)
   Meaning, a change in lower level will not affect upper levels
-->Data independence refers characteristic of being able to modify the schema at one level of the database
   system without altering the schema at the next higher level.
